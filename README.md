# Tetris

Tetris in C++ with SFML.  First semi-complete program.  First Git push.

Be gentle.

I'd call it a working program.  There are obviousy a lot of improvements to make, especially graphically, but the core
of the game is there.  I've started adding documentation, too.  I'm sure it is overkill, but since this is all for 
practice, I may as well go all the way, right?  I'm sure spreading it out over all of these different files is overkill
for the program too. Oh well.
